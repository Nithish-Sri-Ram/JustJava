// Buffer is a very crucial element in programming, used to mediate the data between the sender and receiver.
// Example: A YouTube video will buffer until the content is partially loaded on our end to be played, 
// because the speed at which the data is sent and received is different.
// For our context, we can think of it like a bucket - we wait until it is filled, then we take a bath, and again wait for it to be filled.
// Data is sent in the form of bytes.
// Java provides 2 classes of input and output:
// ByteStream (1 byte at a time) - InputStream and OutputStream - There are lots of classes inheriting from these classes.
// CharacterStream (2 bytes at a time) - Reader and Writer.
