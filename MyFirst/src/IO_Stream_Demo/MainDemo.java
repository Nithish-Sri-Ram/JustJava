//Buffer is a very crutial element in programming which is used mediate the data between the sender and reciver 
//Eg: Youtube video will buffer until the content is patially loaded in our end for it to be played - because the speed at which the data is sent and recived is different 
//For our context we can think of it like a bucket - we wait until it is filled and we take bath and again wait for it to be filled 
//data is sent in the form of bytes
//Java provides 2 classes of input and output 
//Bytestream (1 bytes at a time) - InputStream and OutputStream - There are lots of classes inheriting from these classes
//Charectarstream (2 bytes at a time) - Reader and Writer
