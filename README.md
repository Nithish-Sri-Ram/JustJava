## AWTPractice

This directory contains code related to AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) in Java. AWT is used for creating GUI applications in Java. The examples here will help you understand how to create basic GUI components like buttons, text fields, checkboxes, and more.

- **AWTPractice.java**: Demonstrates basic AWT setup.
- **CheckboxDemo.java**: Shows how to create checkboxes.
- **Counter.java**: A simple counter application using AWT.
- **FirstApp.java**: Your first AWT application.
- **ListBoxDemo.java**: Demonstrates how to use list boxes in AWT.
- **ScrollDemo.java**: Example of scrollbars in AWT.
- **TextAreaDemo.java**: Handling multiple lines of input.
- **TextFieldDemo.java**: Basic text field usage in AWT.

## Database

This section focuses on Java's database connectivity using JDBC. You'll find examples demonstrating how to connect to databases, execute queries, and handle result sets.

- **Database.java**: Connects to a SQLite database, executes queries, and processes results.
- **Trial.java**: Contains various trials and experimental code snippets for database interaction.

## JavaDocDemo

Here you’ll find examples of how to use JavaDoc to document your code. JavaDoc is a tool that generates HTML documentation from comments in your source code.

- **Book.java**: Example class documented with JavaDoc.
- **JavaDocDemo.java**: Demonstrates JavaDoc tags and their usage.

## MyFirst

This is the main directory where a variety of Java programs covering different topics are stored. Below is a breakdown of sub-directories and some key files.

### AbstractClasses

Examples of how abstract classes work in Java. Abstract classes allow you to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses.

### Collection

This directory covers Java Collections Framework, including ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, and more. It's essential for understanding how to manage groups of objects.

### DateAndTime

Covers Java's Date and Time API, both old and new (pre and post Java 8). Learn how to manipulate dates, times, and time zones effectively.

### ExceptionHandling

Learn how to handle exceptions in Java. This directory contains examples of try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, and the best practices for robust error handling.

### Generics

Understand how Java generics work. This directory contains examples that show how to write classes, methods, and interfaces with generic types.

### IO_Stream_Demo

Focuses on Java's Input/Output API, specifically streams. You'll find examples of file handling, reading and writing to streams, and object serialization.

### JavaMasteryCourse

Contains advanced Java topics and examples. This is useful for learners who have a basic understanding of Java and want to deepen their knowledge.

### LambdaProgs

Learn about Lambda expressions introduced in Java 8. This directory includes functional programming concepts and examples of using Lambda expressions.

### LangPackages

Contains examples on Java's core language packages, such as `java.lang`. Explore classes like `String`, `Math`, and more.

### LinkedListDemo

Dedicated to understanding the LinkedList data structure in Java. It contains examples of basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Multithreading

Learn about Java’s multithreading capabilities. This directory contains examples of thread creation, synchronization, inter-thread communication, and more.

### NestedInnerClass

Focuses on Java's inner classes and nested classes, including static and non-static nested classes.

### NetworkProgramming

Explore Java's networking capabilities, including examples of creating sockets, handling HTTP requests, and more.
